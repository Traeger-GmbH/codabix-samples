# Codabix Samples
Here you will find sample scripts, templates, projects, use cases and more using our I4.0 middleware Codabix. The contents of this repository can be used for reference implementations, snippets for custom scenarios and guidance how requirements can be addressed. These samples are therefore good points to getting started for integrators, developers and users of our communication data bridge for things (Codabix). Each sample is provided as it is without any promise regarding its accuracy and correctness especially in productive environments.
