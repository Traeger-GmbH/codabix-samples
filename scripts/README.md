# Scripts
Here you will find sample scripts you can use in our I4.0 middleware Codabix.
## How to import a sample
1. Copy the content of a sample script.
2. Add a new script in Codabix. You can do this by selecting the "Scripts" tab and then clicking on the plus icon at the top left.![add_script_screenshot](https://github.com/Traeger-GmbH/codabix-samples/assets/54576581/10dd3830-b8d6-48ad-807c-10d60c5ab8ae)
3. Enter a name for your script and then click on "ok" to create a new script.![create_script_screenshot](https://github.com/Traeger-GmbH/codabix-samples/assets/54576581/adf7a39b-8473-4c9e-8ac3-30b7d1101fdd)
4. You can now open the script by selecting the script and then clicking on the script icon.![open_script_screenshot](https://github.com/Traeger-GmbH/codabix-samples/assets/54576581/6b68628c-d135-469d-a5f3-a73d6386a230)
5. Now you just need to replace the default code in the script file with the code copied earlier from one of the examples.
